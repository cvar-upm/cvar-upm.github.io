[Aerostack](https://github.com/cvar-upm/aerostack/wiki) is a software framework that helps developers design and build the control architecture of aerial robotic systems, integrating multiple heterogeneous computational solutions (e.g., computer vision algorithms, motion controllers, self-localization and mapping methods, motion planning algorithms, etc.).

[Behaviorlib](https://github.com/cvar-upm/behaviorlib) is a ROS-based software library to program robot behaviors that has been designed to facilitate their coordinated execution. Each robot behavior is programmed as a module that controls a separate robot functionality together with a set of functions for execution management. 

[Behavior Coordinator CBC](https://github.com/cvar-upm/behavior_coordinator_cbc) is a ROS-based software development tool for building the behavior coordination system of autonomous robots. Behavior coordination is done using an algorithm for constraint-based configuration (CBC).
