**Example projects**


Our research activities are mainly oriented to two main objectives: 

- Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) complex missions using on board sensors (i.e. vision and lidar) and on-board computing for autonomously flying in environments where GPS is not available (e.g. indoors) or where GPS doesn't provide enough accuracy (e.g. industrial inspection and/or manoeuvres close to obstacles).  

- Autonomous image/video recognition and detection using machine learning (e.g. deep learning), as well as image processing techniques, mainly used for aerial images an also for other kind of images. Reinforcement learning for controlling UAV is also one of our main research topics, based on both direct visual info and pose estimation.
