Sample of recent projects:
"DAR Project for Aircraft Inspection” for AIRBUS Defence & Space. https://vimeo.com/showcase/6617361
“Boiler Inspection in Meirama Thermal Power Plant” for Naturgy https://vimeo.com/showcase/5782536
Autonomous image/video recognition and detection using Machine Learning, e.g. DL, as well as Image Processing techniques, mainly used for aerial images an also for other kind of images. Reinforcement Learning for controlling UAV is also one of our main research topics, based on both direct visual info and pose estimation. Sample of recent projects:
“Tropical Plants Detection and Recognition from Aerial Images taken by Drones” for INDIGO Drones, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le0PggkA_oM&feature=emb_logo
“Electric Tower Inspection” for several companies (Fenosa, Prysma, REE, Aeromedia). https://vimeo.com/showcase/5782445 
We are also awarded in the very top international competitions in drones autonomy: IMAV12, IMAV13, IARC14, IMAV16, IMAV17, IMAV 2019 and MBZIRC20.
