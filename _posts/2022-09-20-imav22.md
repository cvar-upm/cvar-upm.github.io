In mid-September our team attended to the International Micro Air Vehicle Conference and Competition (IMAV) 2022 held in Delft. From there we returned with a special award in the Nanocopter AI challenge [(Best Gate Passing)](https://2022.imavs.org/index.php/results/), and with a pleasant experience in the Package Delivery challenge, our first competition journey in flight outdoors.
